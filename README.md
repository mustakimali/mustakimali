  ## 💻 Tech Journey
  
  - In love with Rust
  - Deep experience with C# and .NET ecosystem
  - Pragmatic engineer who believes in "it depends" over dogma
  - Always learning, forever curious
  
  ## ⚡ Fun Facts
  
  - Aspiring musician with a growing collection of instruments (still working on the "playing" part!)
  - Grew up in one of the most densely populated cities in the world, now living in a near-empty English village
  - Firm believer that the best code are stupidly simple and read from top to bottom, left to right with just enough jumping around
  - Hiking, comics, games and golf - not interested in any of these!
